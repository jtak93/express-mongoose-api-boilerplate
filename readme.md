### Install
[Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/) is suggested in order to develop with a local database.

```


### Start the server
Before you start the server, the server requires a couple of environment variables to be set.  You should get these in an email.

Adjust the config variables to app specifics.

```
npm start
```
Note: it will run on the specified port ENV variable with a default port of 4000
